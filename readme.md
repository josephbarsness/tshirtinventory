**T-SHIRT INVENTORY**

I own a lot of T-Shirts.  Many of them I was able to acquire for free.  For a long time now I have collected these shirts to the point where my collection has now reached a size that I can no longer maintain.  I want to inventory every t-shirt that I own so that when I begin to throw away my t-shirts or add new ones I will have a visual representation of the shirts that I have owned.

This is also my attempt to complete the github 30 day commit challenge.  My goal is to commit at least once a day with some type of significant update.
